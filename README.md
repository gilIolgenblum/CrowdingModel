# CrowdingModel
Mean-Field Model devolped to fit and analyze protein folding experiments in the presence of cosolutes or crowders.
Our model covers not only volume exclusion and protein-cosolute soft interactions, but also the commonly ignored cosolute-solvent non-ideal mixing interactions.
The model is explained in the notebook and a detailed example of how to deploy the model is presented.
